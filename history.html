<h2>Acoustic couplers</h2>
<p>The first modems were 'acoustic couplers' that connected to the telephone line via a landline handset.
    These were common as AT&T had a monopoly on phone lines, however the FCC said that electronic devices could
    be used on the network, as long as they used an acoustic coupler.
</p>

<h2>The Smartmodem</h2>
<p>The next major advance in modems was the Hayes Smartmodem, introduced in 1981.
    The Smartmodem was an otherwise standard 103A 300-bit/s direct-connect modem,
    but it was attached to a small microcontroller that watched the data stream for
    certain character strings representing commands. This allowed both data and commands
    to be sent through a single serial port.
